			<pText><![CDATA[The Sensor Cloud service life-cycle model is illustrated in this section. Figure 11.4 depicts the Sensor-Cloud service life cycle. The users of the sensors can select the appropriate service template and request the required service instances. These service instances are provided automatically and freely to the users, which can then be deleted quickly when they become useless. From a single service template, multiple numbers of service instances can be created. Service provider regulates the service templates and can add new service templates as and when required by a different number of users.]]></pText>
